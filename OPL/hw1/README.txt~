Ada

1. The enviorment was very easy. Using the jgrasp ide it was
   easy enough to run working Ada code. Also Ada is very readable,
   albeit a little intimidating.

2. Trying to program in this language was difficult. As seen
   in the function my partner and I tried to implement, even
   though it followed the same structure as the others, it
   was marked "non-visible". The other challenging part was
   trying to work around variables needing to be declared
   before the main "begin" statement. This makes user input
   incredibly difficult to implement, though our attempted
   function tries to address that.

3. At run time, no one language seemed to be any faster or slower
   than another. However I would believe that Ada is the least
   efficient of all of the languages, based on its sheer length.

4. Strangely enough, I like how wordy Ada is. It's fairly clear
   what everything does just by looking at it. I feel like given
   enough practice with the language, it would be relatively
   straightforward. However, I greatly dislike how not beginner
   friendly Ada is, and how you must declare all variables before
   "main". This greatly affects user input.

5. Iterators weren't used in the Ada implementation. The closest
   thing to iteration was for loops.

C#

1. This language was a breath of fresh air compared to Ada. Having
   both a Java and C/C++ background, this language was very
   straightforward. It had many of the familar and useful OOP
   tools, such as .length and iterators.

2. The only hard part was adjusting to a new syntax.

3. At run time, no one language seemed to be any faster or slower
   than another.
